# ESP32-S3 Development Board

This repository documents a **personal ESP32-S3 based development board**
designed for learning, experimentation, and embedded systems development.

The focus of this project is on **hardware design, board architecture,
and design decisions**, rather than firmware or application-level software.

## Project Overview

The ESP32-S3 Development Board is intended as a flexible platform for:
- Embedded systems learning
- IoT and connectivity-based experiments
- Custom peripheral interfacing and prototyping

The board is designed to support USB-based programming,
stable power regulation, and easy GPIO access for development work.

This repository follows a **documentation-first approach**, emphasizing
clarity, structure, and design understanding.
